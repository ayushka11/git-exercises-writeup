## **merge-conflict**

`git merge another-piece-of-work` to initiate the merge

we get a merge conflict as 

```
Auto-merging equation.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in equation.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
we check equation.txt using `nano equation.txt` and edit it to be 2 + 3 = 5

then add equation.txt and commit using same commands
